Fork of the original tool for interfacing with the on-board microcontroller on the early linkstations. The original is still included as part of the installation for the LS-GL Debian Installer.

This version includes a few tweaks/fixes to allow the longer commands used to contol LCD displays to function properly. 

Information about the messages that can be used can be found here:
https://buffalonas.miraheze.org/wiki/Terastation_Microcontroller_Interface

There is also a Python3 library for operating this interface:
https://github.com/1000001101000/Python_buffalo_libmicon

Usage Examples:

Send the "boot_end" signal which tells the mcu that the device booted successfully (and not to restart)
micro-evtd -s 0003

Set a message on the LCD screen:
micro-evtd -s 20905465726173746174696f6e2061726d2044656269616e20496e7374616c6c657231

I've tested it on armel/armhf and amd64 based Terastations
